Logger package is no longer maintained because there is many other alternatives that solve the logging in a better way. Some of those alternatives are [Logrus][logrus], [Zerolog][zerolog] or [Zap][zap].

[zerolog]: https://github.com/rs/zerolog
[zap]: https://github.com/uber-go/zap
[logrus]: https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus
